1. Architecture & stack (practical, no overengineering)

Given your background, I’d do this as a Python web app that:
	•	runs locally with streamlit run app.py
	•	is responsive, so you can use it on your phone
	•	uses well-known libraries instead of magic black boxes

Core stack:
	•	Frontend/UI: Streamlit￼
	•	Super fast for prototyping; no HTML/JS required.
	•	Works great with sliders, sidebars, tabs – perfect for “math playground”.
	•	Math engine:
	•	sympy (symbolic calculus: derivatives, integrals, limits, series)
	•	numpy (numeric evaluation on grids)
	•	Plots:
	•	matplotlib or plotly (Streamlit supports both; Plotly gives easy zoom on mobile)
	•	Packaging/deploy:
	•	v1: run locally
	•	later: deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud / simple Docker container

This keeps everything fully transparent: you control the code, you know what each button does.

2. Feature roadmap – what your app actually does

Think of it as 4 “labs” instead of one huge app.

Lab 1 – Scientific + Symbolic Calculator (MVP)

Goal: Replace random calculators with something you own.

Features:
	•	Expression input: sin(x) + x^2, exp(-x^2), etc.
	•	Choose mode: numeric / symbolic
	•	Buttons / toggles:
	•	✅ Evaluate at x = a
	•	✅ Differentiate once / n times
	•	✅ Indefinite / definite integral
	•	✅ Limit as x → a (both sides)
	•	Show:
	•	Expression in nice LaTeX
	•	Result symbolically (when possible) and numerically

Lab 2 – Single-variable Calculus Visualizer

Goal: Build intuition for derivatives, limits, and integrals.

Page: “Function & Derivative”

Inputs:
	•	Function f(x) as text
	•	Slider for x0
	•	Interval [xmin, xmax]

Visuals:
	•	Plot f(x) on [xmin, xmax]
	•	Tangent line at x0, with:
	•	numeric slope f'(x0)
	•	symbolic derivative printed above
	•	Optional:
	•	small “zoom around x0” plot to see derivative as limit of slopes

Page: “Limits”
	•	Same f(x) input
	•	Point a
	•	Two sliders: h_left, h_right approaching 0
	•	Show:
	•	f(a - h_left) and f(a + h_right)
	•	lim_{x→a-} f(x) and lim_{x→a+} f(x) if SymPy can compute
	•	Plot with highlighted neighborhoods around a

Page: “Integrals & Area”
	•	f(x), interval [a, b], and number of rectangles n
	•	Show:
	•	Riemann sum (left/mid/right rectangles)
	•	Exact ∫ f(x) dx and definite integral from a to b (if SymPy handles it)
	•	Visualization of rectangles under the curve

⸻

Lab 3 – Linear Algebra: Vectors & Transformations

Goal: Make vectors and matrices visual.

Page: “2D Vectors”
	•	Inputs: coordinates of v and w
	•	Show:
	•	2D plane with arrows for v, w, v+w, scalar multiples
	•	Toggle: show basis vectors e1, e2

Page: “Matrix as Transformation”
	•	Matrix A (2×2 to start; you can add 3×3 later)
	•	Visual:
	•	Grid or unit square transformed by A
	•	Show A * v for a chosen vector v (with slider / input)
	•	Extra:
	•	Decompose A if possible: eigenvalues/eigenvectors
	•	Highlight eigenvectors on the plot

⸻

Lab 4 – Multivariable Calculus (later)
	•	f(x, y) → 3D surface + contour plot
	•	Point (x0, y0) with gradient vector shown
	•	Path visualization: directional derivatives along a line

This can be v2, after you’re happy with single-variable stuff.

3. UI sketch (so it doesn’t get messy)

Global layout (Streamlit style):
	•	Sidebar:
	•	Select Lab:
	•	Calculator
	•	Calculus 1D
	•	Linear Algebra
	•	(later) Multivariable
	•	Each lab: radio buttons for sub-page
	•	Main area:
	•	Top: title + short explanation (“What you’re seeing and why it matters”)
	•	Left column: controls (inputs, sliders)
	•	Right column: plots + LaTeX formulas

Example:

Sidebar → “Calculus 1D” → “Derivative Visualizer”
Main:
	•	Input f(x) = sin(x) + x**2
	•	Slider x0 = 1.2
	•	Graph + tangent + text: f'(x) = cos(x) + 2x, f'(1.2) ≈ ...
